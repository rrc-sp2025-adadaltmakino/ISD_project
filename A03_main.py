# 5a. Create a second Client object with data of your choice.
# 5b. Create a SavingsAccount object with data of your choice, using the client_number




# 6. Use the ChequingAccount and SavingsAccount objects created
# in steps 3 and 5 above to perform transactions (deposits and withdraws)
# which would cause the Subject (BankAccount) to notify the Observer
# (Client) as well as transactions that would not
# cause the Subject to notify the Observer.  Ensure each
# BankAccount object performs at least 3 transactions.
# REMINDER: the deposit() and withdraw() methods can raise exceptions
# ensure the methods are invoked using proper exception handling such
# that any exception messages are printed to the console.
